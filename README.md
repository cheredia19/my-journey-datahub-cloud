My journey with DataHub Cloud started in April 2024, when I was contacted by Rufus Pollock via Upwork. My profile says I'm a data journalist, so I think it clicked on him. I did not know who Pollock was at the time. So, when I googled his name, I found out. 

I could not believe that such an important person in the world of data contacted this humble Venezuelan who uses data for journalistic purposes.
