My journey with DataHub Cloud began in April 2024 when Rufus Pollock contacted me through Upwork. My profile there says I'm a data journalist, so I think it clicked on him. At the time, I didn't know who Pollock was. When I Googled his name, I found out. 

I couldn't believe such an important person in the data world would contact this humble Venezuelan who uses data for journalistic purposes. Also, considering that Venezuela is not exactly known for its open data policies. *Au contraire*. It's hard to work with data in my country because of the lack of open and updated datasets. So, data people have to either build their data or look for datasets on foreign websites and NGOs.

But that's an issue we can assess later.

When Rufus contacted me, I was honored but also intrigued. Then came the interview, and I learned about the DataHub platform. What I understood (at the time) was that a lot of the things I do with data could have been done within DataHub.

But then I discovered, with practice, that it wasn't as automatic a process as I initially thought. I still had to process data sets outside of the platform. So, I still relied on Excel/Google Spreadsheets and, if necessary, Python or R.

Then, something became a frustrating topic in my particular learning curve. My charts didn't show on the DataHub platform, even though I was doing everything right. It took around two weeks and a couple of video calls with a DataHub developer to figure it out.

Since then, I've done journalistic articles focused on several topics, such as [the 50 most followed YouTube channels](https://datahub.io/@cheredia19/50-yt-channels-most-subscribers), the [100 worst movies according to Rotten Tomatoes](https://datahub.io/@cheredia19/100-worst-movies-all-time-by-rt), [data analysis of the Paris Olympic Games](https://datahub.io/@cheredia19/paris-2024-osg-athletes), or [the state of press freedom in the world by 2024](https://datahub.io/@cheredia19/press-freedom-2024), among others.
